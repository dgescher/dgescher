Hi, 
I'm currently learning to perform epigenetic analyses, and also to use programms that are operated via bash which sometimes includes (for me) overextending problems...
Thus, I'm a very newcomer and you will perhaps read ridiculously simple questions from me, sorry by now :-(  
All the more I'm very thankful for every helpful comment, even if elementary.
Hopefully I will learn and getting better soon!
Kindly, Dorothee
